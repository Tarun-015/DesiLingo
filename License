## How to Deploy

1. **GitHub Setup**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Upload all the files from the project structure
   - Make sure to include the assets folder if you have any images

2. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - Sign up for a free Vercel account
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a static site and deploy it
   - Your live URL will be something like: `https://local-lingo.vercel.app`

3. **Replit Alternative**:
   - Create a new HTML/CSS/JS repl on Replit
   - Upload all the files
   - Run the project and share the live URL

## Demo Script

Here's a suggested script for your demo video:

1. **Introduction (0:00-0:15)**
   - "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is Local Lingo - your AI-powered local language buddy for navigating India's linguistic diversity."

2. **Problem Statement (0:15-0:45)**
   - Show images of Indian cities with signs in different languages
   - "India has 22 official languages and thousands of dialects. For students, tourists, or migrants, not understanding local language can be frustrating and isolating."

3. **Solution Overview (0:45-1:15)**
   - Demonstrate the app interface
   - "Local Lingo solves this with three simple ways to bridge the language gap: snap photos of signs, speak naturally, or type text - and get instant translations with cultural context."

4. **Feature Walkthrough (1:15-3:30)**
   - **Signboard Translation**: Show uploading a Hindi sign and getting English translation
   - **Voice Translation**: Speak a Kannada phrase and show English translation
   - **Text Translation**: Type a Tamil sentence and show Hindi translation
   - Highlight the cultural context explanation for each

5. **Technology Stack (3:30-4:00)**
   - "We built this with Tesseract.js for OCR, Web Speech API for voice, and GPT-powered translation. The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design."

6. **Closing (4:00-4:30)**
   - "Local Lingo is just the beginning. Imagine adding more languages, offline mode, or conversation features. We'd love your feedback to make cities more accessible to everyone!"
   - Call-to-action: "Try it yourself at [your-vercel-url] and star our GitHub repo if you like it!"

## Notes

1. For a production app, you would need to:
   - Replace the simulated translation functions with actual API calls to Google Translate or GPT
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement user authentication if saving preferences/history
   - Optimize for mobile devices

2. The current implementation uses:
   - Tesseract.js for client-side OCR (no server needed)
   - Web Speech API for voice (browser-based, no backend)
   - Simulated translation for demo purposes

3. To add GPT functionality, you would:
   - Create an OpenAI account
   - Get an API key
   - Replace the `simulateContextExplanation` function with actual API calls
   - Use prompts like: "Explain the cultural context of this [language] phrase: '[text]' in 2-3 sentences"

This complete implementation gives you everything you need for your Devpost submission, including all technical components and presentation materials.
