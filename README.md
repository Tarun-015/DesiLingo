# 🪔 DesiLingo – Your Local Language Buddy

**DesiLingo** is an AI-powered assistant that helps users navigate multilingual cities in India by translating signboards, speech, and everyday phrases into their preferred language — with cultural context, accessibility, and simplicity.

## 🌍 Problem

Millions in India face challenges when they migrate to new states — unfamiliar signboards, dialects, or even menus become daily roadblocks. Language barriers isolate people from essential services and opportunities.

## 💡 Solution

DesiLingo bridges the gap using AI. Users can point their phone at a signboard or speak into the app, and it translates the message into their chosen language, while adding cultural context like, “This is a government health center. Opens at 10am.”
